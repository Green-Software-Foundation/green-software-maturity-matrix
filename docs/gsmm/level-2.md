# Level 2 - Aware

You know your organization’s scope 1 and 2 emissions. You have a few projects driving greenness within your organization and beyond it using this data (by putting pressure on suppliers, for example). Your engineers have had some training in green systems, operations and patterns.

| Axis      | State |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Whole organization energy commitments | CZero for scope 1, 2 and 3 by 2040 (note you may already be so-called “Carbon neutral”) |
| Carbon footprint | you know what it is (scope 1 and 2) |
| Co2 equivalent metrics | annual, quarterly or monthly numbers from all suppliers (including outsourcers) and own systems for scope 1/2 |
| Server resource management | occasional spring cleans where you manually turn off idle or low value systems and delete/archive unneeded data |
| Energy resource management | hosting in green regions/buying renewable energy |
| Minimize end user device embodied carbon waste (assume circular economy) | some adhoc targets in place |
| Minimize server hardware embodied carbon waste | some adhoc systems and some systems using multi-tenancy to improve utilization |
| Product management | carbon awareness part of product design |
| Education | basic training for all engineers & PMs. Champions are trained |
