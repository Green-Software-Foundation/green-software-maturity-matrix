# Level 1 - Aspiring

You have individuals in your organization who care about green targets for technology but no systemic interest, processes or commitments. Some development teams measure their carbon emissions. This is where almost all of us are today.

| Axis      | State |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Whole organization energy commitments | none/CZero by 2050 |
| Carbon footprint | you don’t know what it is |
| Co2 equivalent metrics | No metrics |
| Server resource management | No rightsizing takes place and zero knowledge about unused ”zombie” systems |
| Energy resource management | None - running on demand |
| Minimize end user device embodied carbon waste (assume circular economy) | No end user device longevity targets |
| Minimize server hardware embodied carbon waste | No server utilization targets |
| Product management | Not carbon aware |
| Education | None/ad-hoc, individual |
