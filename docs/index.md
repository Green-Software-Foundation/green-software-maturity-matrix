## Executive Summary

The Green Software Maturity Matrix (GSMM) is a self-assessment tool. It helps organizations understand the extent to which they have implemented green principles, patterns, and processes for building and operating their software systems. The purpose is to “raise the floor and the ceiling.” I.e. to lift the behavior of the laggards on sustainable strategy and inspire those doing well to achieve more by showing what the leaders in this area are aiming for.
