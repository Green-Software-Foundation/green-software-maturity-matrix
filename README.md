# Green Software Maturity Matrix

The Green Software Maturity Matrix is a self-assessment tool. It helps organisations understand the extent to which they have implemented green principles, patterns, and processes for building and operating their software systems.

This project is run through the [Community Working Group](https://grnsft.org/community-wg) in the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation).

## Scope
The matrix addresses four problems. It answers the questions:

* "Where do I start?"
* "Where am I now?"
* "What am I heading towards?"
* "How do I know I am making progress?"
