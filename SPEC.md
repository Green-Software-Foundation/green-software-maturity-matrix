# Green Software Maturity Matrix

## Executive summary

The green software maturity matrix is a self-assessment tool. It helps organizations understand the extent to which they have implemented green principles, patterns, and processes for building and operating their software systems. The purpose is to “raise the floor and the ceiling.” I.e. to lift the behavior of the laggards on sustainable strategy and inspire those doing well to achieve more by showing what the leaders in this area are aiming for.

## What is a maturity matrix?

Maturity matrices are used in fields like project management and cybersecurity to help organizations grok where they currently stand in terms of best practices, as well as the steps they can take to achieve higher levels of performance. The green software maturity matrix is a framework for assessing the level of a tech organization’s ability to handle the energy transition. 

The purpose of moving up the GSMM levels is not merely to be “ethical” or good. It is a risk management strategy to provide resilience to:

* Tightening ESG and other (e.g. EU) reporting requirements around sustainable IT. 
* Physical disruption to IT systems caused by climate change.
* Pricing changes, for example the impact of highly differential dynamic electricity tariffs or reuse, repair, and recycle rules from the EU. 
* Hiring and retaining employees who want to be part of the solution to humanity’s greatest challenge. This is particularly true for younger staff.

### The history of maturity matrices

The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), which is a bit of a mouthful, was originally developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University. The CMMI is a framework for assessing and guiding organizations' process improvement efforts, and has 5 maturity levels:

* Level 1: Initial - Processes are unpredictable, poorly controlled, and reactive at best.
* Level 2: Reactively managed - Per-project processes. Often still reactive.
* Level 3: Defined - Processes are standardized, documented, well understood and reviewed.
* Level 4: Quantitatively Managed - Processes are measured and controlled.
* Level 5: Optimizing - Continuous improvement occurs based on quantitative feedback.

We reckon this broadly means:

* Level 1: You are floundering. No organization level strategy. Maybe a few individuals who care and/or are knowledgeable. Purely reactive. This is where most of us are on being green at this point.
* Level 2: You are starting to get some handle on it but without consistency. Mostly reactive. How advanced you are varies by project and team. You have the bare minimum of data.
* Level 3: You are good. You have decent, basic org-wide green tech knowledge and data. You have defined processes for handling that data that are applied across your organization. 
* Level 4: You are awesome. You can measure your progress dynamically (i.e. you have real -time data).
* Level 5: You have ascended to the next plane of existence. You monitor and improve based on your real-time data. You give aspirational talks at tech conferences and what people are aspiring to is what you have been doing for ages. You are the tech equivalent of a being of pure energy. Think Yoda with a keyboard. 

What does this mean in a green software context for an organization? This is tough. Almost all of us are at level 1 right now because going green is the most difficult project our industry faces.

* Level 1 (Aspiring): You have individuals in your organization who care about green targets for technology but no systemic interest, processes or commitments. Some development teams measure their carbon emissions. This is where almost all of us are today.
* Level 2 (Aware): You know your organization’s scope 1 and 2 emissions. You have a few projects driving greenness within your organization and beyond it using this data (by putting pressure on suppliers, for example). Your engineers have had some training in green systems, operations and patterns. 
* Level 3 (Acting): You know your scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions on a daily, weekly, monthly or annual basis. You have been acting on reducing the scope 1 and 2 emissions for a while and your carbon footprint is going down per some consistent, org-specific unit of output, e.g per order. You have defined processes for every team including regular reporting and reviewing of CO2 equivalent emissions for all IT related operations. Your PM teams have a remit to avoid waste, for example saving no more data than is necessary or implementing any functionality before need, and you can switch off zombie or low use services (“Lightswitch Ops”). You have automatic resilience to weather-related operational risks (e.g. DC outages). You are aware of and discuss the tradeoffs between embodied carbon and carbon generated by energy usage. You have plans in place to minimize your embodied carbon footprint, including significantly extending the life expectancy of both the servers and end user devices you run on. 
* Level 4 (Awesome): You have a measurement system in place that is producing good real-time scope 1, 2, and 3 data and although it’s not currently driving the business day-to-day, the business is very aware of it. Using the more limited scope 1, 2, and 3 data you have had for a while, you have already achieved net carbon zero using no more than 10% offsets. (Note offsets are highly problematic but they demonstrate you are regularly measuring). You perform demand shaping; pre-calculation and caching; and time and location shifting, for example, to adapt your workloads to current conditions. You automatically delete or archive data that isn’t in regular use. Services no longer in use are automatically turned off and rightsizing happens automatically (i.e. you apply SRE principles). Your applications are Lean and you constantly review and retire functionality that is insufficiently used. Your organizational strategy has been aligned with being green as a business goal - perhaps for reasons of ESG, cost, resilience, or market access to the EU - and delivery on CO2 targets is regularly discussed and reported at senior level. Your total carbon footprint is going down even as you grow. You are also actively driving the carbon footprint of your suppliers to go down. You never cause hardware less than ten years old to become end of life either by lack of security patches or lack of backwards compatibility in your applications. You are actively driving the carbon footprint of your customers to go down (beyond simply their use of your services and devices) for example by providing scope 3 reporting for your goods and services. Examples (for some of it): Google, AWS, MS. https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/meet-savannah-goodman-of-google
* Level 5 (Inspiring): You’ve got there. You have achieved 24/7 CFE and require no more than 1% offsets to handle hard to shift embodied carbon. You have team level measurable goals (OKRs etc) for your CO2 measurements. You are optimizing for minimal CO2 emissions using your dynamic, real-time data. You and the services you rely on use real-time information including dynamic grid energy data to make rapid, quantitative decisions that allow you to be greener. This could (and probably will) be via a service you use rather than something you built yourself. You are already an SRE-aware organization that thinks in terms of [error budgets](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/sre-error-budgets-and-maintenance-windows) for outages and downtime and you now think about carbon budgets in the same way. Using predictions based on factors such as weather and grid congestion, you change and move almost all of your workloads ahead of time to match your electricity requirements to local green power availability (aka 24/7 CFE) and any time sensitive workloads are highly optimized for minimal electricity use. You never cause hardware to become end of life either by lack of security patches or lack of backwards compatibility. You are ready for the energy transition and won’t be caught by surprise by sudden new rules or constraints.
